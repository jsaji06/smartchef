## Special Notes
1. While, in theory, the installation and setup processes for this application should work, should you get an error that looks like the following:
  ```bash
  Error: Cannot find module '../src/assert'
      Require stack:
      - /Users/USERNAME/Downloads/smartchef-main 2/node_modules/.bin/concurrently
          at Module._resolveFilename (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1144:15)
          ...
          at Module._load (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1023:12)
          at Function.executeUserEntryPoint [as runMain] (node:internal/modules/run_main:135:12) {
        code: 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND',
        requireStack: [
          '/Users/USERNAME/Downloads/smartchef-main 2/node_modules/.bin/concurrently'
        ]
      }
  ```
Please run the following commands:
  ```bash
  rm -rf node_modules
  rm package-lock.json # or yarn.lock if using yarn
  npm install
  ```
This eliminates the possibility of any corrupt dependencies that can interfere with the application.
